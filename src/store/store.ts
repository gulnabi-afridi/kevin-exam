// QUESTION: Why would we use thunk middleware? What advantage does this give us?
// ANSWER: ==================ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
// Thunk middleware is used in Redux for handling asynchronous actions.
//   Advantages ðŸ‘‡
//It allows dispatching functions (thunks) as actions, which helps with async operations like API calls.
// Thunks delay dispatching actions, enabling async tasks before updating the store.
// Thunks are written in a simple, synchronous style, making code easier to read.
// Thunks receive dispatch and getState functions, offering access to the store and allowing multiple or conditional actions.

//  ANSWER END HERE =========>
const composedEnhancer = applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware);

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  enhancers: [composedEnhancer],
  devTools: true,
