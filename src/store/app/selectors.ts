// QUESTION: Why are we using createSelector here? What is the advantage over
// plain functions?

// ==================> ANSWER ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
//createSelector is used to create memoized selectors in Redux. The advantage of using createSelector over plain functions is that it optimizes the performance of selecting data from the Redux store. Memoization is a technique that caches the result of a function based on its arguments and returns the cached result when the same arguments are provided again. This helps to avoid unnecessary recalculations when the same selector is used multiple times with the same input.
// In our case, multiple selectors are created using createSelector to derive data from the Redux store state (selectRootState). Each selector depends on one or more other selectors or raw state data, and createSelector ensures that the computation is only performed when the input data changes.
